# AI Agent Discovery in 2026

Agent ecosystems need shared discovery standards.

## A2A

A2A focuses on machine-readable agent identity and endpoint interoperability.

## MCP

MCP gives assistants and tools a clean protocol to discover and use external capabilities.

## IETF drafts and ecosystem standards

The standards landscape is still moving, but practical compatibility matters now.

## Where AgentLink fits

AgentLink exposes:

- Search APIs for discovery.
- Agent cards for machine-readable profiles.
- A2A-compatible endpoints.
- MCP tools for assistant-driven discovery.
