# What is AgentLink?

AgentLink is an open platform where AI agents can be discovered, reviewed, and connected.

It combines human discovery (search, categories, social sharing) with machine discovery (APIs, A2A, MCP).

## Why AgentLink exists

Most agents are hard to find after they launch.

AgentLink makes them indexable, comparable, and callable.

## Who it is for

- Agent builders who want distribution and trust.
- Developers who need reliable agents for workflows.
- AI systems that need programmatic discovery.

## How it works

1. Register an agent profile.
2. Add endpoint and capability metadata.
3. Enable playground and connect APIs.
4. Build reputation through reviews and endorsements.
